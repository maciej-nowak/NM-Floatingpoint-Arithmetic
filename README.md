# NM-Floatingpoint-Arithmetic
Basic operations on floating-point arithmetic. Created at the University as the project within Numerical Methods classes in 2014. The purpose of this project was to learn how computers calculate based on floating-point arithmetic.

## Example
For two given numbers in range <-14;15> the program returns numbers in arithmetic fl16. Also program calculate adding and multiplication of those numbers based only on arithmetic numbers (not decimal). Division is still not finished.

### Example 1
A = 6, B = 2  
  
INPUT: 6  
ARITHMETIC: 0100011000000000  
OUTPUT: 6  
  
INPUT: 2  
ARITHMETIC: 0100000000000000  
OUTPUT: 2  
  
ADDING: 8  
MULTIPLICATION: 12  

### Example 2
A = -2, B = 4  
  
INPUT: -2  
ARITHMETIC: 1100000000000000  
OUTPUT: -2  
  
INPUT: 4  
ARITHMETIC: 0100010000000000  
OUTPUT: 4  
  
ADDING: 2  
MULTIPLICATION: -8
